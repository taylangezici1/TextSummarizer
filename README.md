# TextSummarizer
An automatic text summarization program using machine learning

As my graduation project, i made a program that uses machine learning to summarize news letters. For this, i used a news corpus that includes 2225 news letters from BBC Website. But of course, a different corpus can be used.
To train the dataset, it uses the Word2Vec word embedding method. And to summarize, it uses the TextRank algorithm.
